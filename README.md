# Pixel-Art-Maker
A JavaScript Project I designed as a part of Udacity

Note: The main part of the HTML and CSS files were given to me by Udacity for this project and are not my own. The only thing I really did was change up the border a little on the CSS and did some coloring and styling. These files should not be considered my work, only the JavaScript file


For this project I mostly stuck with the HTML and CSS files as they were given to me, and I changed the JaveScript file. If you want to see some original CSS and HTML work I've done, check out my Sample Website Repository.
